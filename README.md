# Permutation-numbers
Permutations can be considered as the orbits of a dynamic system p' = succ(p), where p is a permutation and p' is its successor in the lexycographically ordered set of permutations (+ Nil)
This functions produces those orbits as well as a number of "permutation numbers" derived from those orbits.
